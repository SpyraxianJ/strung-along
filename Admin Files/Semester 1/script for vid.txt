Welcome to group 4's presentation of Strung Along.
Strung Along is a 3D, two player puzzle solver literally set against the backdrop of a marionette stage. 
Today you'll hear from myself, Harper and Andrew discussing some of the most significant parts of the project.

Optimising the feel and character puppets is essential and has continued to offer new challenges. 
Being 3D, the movement is mainly conducted using rigidbody physics, forces and velocity manipulation. Used hand in hand with unity's new input system
this allows us to give the players mechanical flexibility such as short jumping, air movement, coyote time and more.
Players can interact with their environemnt in a number of ways by dragging objects along the ground, climbing their strings and even using the
carefully coded properties of string tangling to raise themselves over certain obstacles.

Taking heavy inspiration from old-timey puppet shows, the strings are a key gimmick in gameplay, restricting both players movement, but also 
providing ways around obstacle that would otherwise be impossible. 

Before we settled on mechanics, I explored a ew alternative options such as using root motion to move the characters around. Root motion basically 
drives the model position from the animation rather than using forces or posisitioning code. While this makes the character movement appear 
more realistic, it requires very tight animations and we decided against using it at this stage.

Beyond the players, the world they interact with also needs to be dynamic. I'll pass it on to harper to discuss the details about our level manager.



Moving into semester 2 we hope to focus on adding the beautiful art assets from our design team as well as polishing the core mechanics until they shine.
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next time.
